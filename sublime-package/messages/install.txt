=======================================

Thank you for installing LSP-fleet!

This package provides Language Server Protocol support for Fleet GitOps
configuration files (default.yml, teams/*.yml, lib/*.yml).

Features:
- Real-time validation of Fleet configuration syntax
- Context-aware autocompletion for fields and values
- Hover documentation for osquery tables and Fleet fields
- File path completions for 'path:' values
- Go-to-definition for referenced files

Getting Started:
1. The LSP binary will be auto-downloaded on first use
2. Open any Fleet GitOps YAML file to activate the server
3. Start typing to see completions and validation

Manual Installation (optional):
If you prefer to manage the binary yourself, set "binary_path" in settings:
  Preferences > Package Settings > LSP > Servers > LSP-fleet > Settings
